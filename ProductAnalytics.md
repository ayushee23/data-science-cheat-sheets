-Product metrics measure how customers interact with your product but not all metrics are created equal
- Product metrics measure how customers are using your product. They help underdtand what's working, what's not, and where you can improve
- Product metrics can be classified under 5 broad categories:
  - Acquisition (number of new signups/leads, CAC)
  - Activation (activation rate, time to activate, free-to-paid conversion) 
  - Engagement (DAU, WAU, MAU, stickiness, feature usage)
  - Retention (retention rate, churn rate, customer lifetime value CLV)
  - Monetization (Net revenue retention (NRR), Monthly recurring revenue (MRR), Average revenue per user ARPU)
    
- Leading(predict future performance) Vs Lagging indicators(reflect past performance); these metrics would depend on product goals. For acquisition, leading metrics could be number of daily new signups and lagging metrics could be annual revenue. Leading metrics drive daily tactics to reach the goal and lagging metrics are about measuring if your actions were successful. Lagging indicators are based on long-term strategy
- Acquisition metrics: great for understanding what marketing channels are working best for your company
  
- Activation metrics: like activation rate and time to activate or complete an important action, show you how well you are moving users from acquisition through that critical “aha” moment where they discover why your product is valuable to them and, in turn, provide value to your business.
  
- Engagement metrics: Users who engage with your product are active users, eg - daily active users, how and how often users interact with the product. It could be sharing a song, editing profile
  
- Retention metrics:  like retention rate, free-to-paid conversions, and churn rate, gauge how many of your users return to your product over a certain period of time. These are critical metrics for your company’s growth. It doesn’t matter how fast you fill the top of your funnel if users are leaking out the bottom just as fast.
  
- Monetization metrics: metrics like average revenue per user, capture how well your business is turning engagement into revenue.



How you define your metrics is important -
For number ofnew signups/leads we want to find high intent users who are more likely to convert
CAC = total acquisition cost across channels/number of customers gained in that period

To measure activation rate, we define an activation event - something that indicates that the customer has started generating value from the product. Eg - sharing songs, adding friends, completing profile. To calculate this, divide the number of people who complete your milestone activation event by the number of users who signed up to use your product.


DAU/WAU/MAU - The way each company defines active users is different. For example, simply opening an app isn’t a great
measure of an active user. You want to measure an action that shows people are using your app and getting
value from it. This is known as a critical event. For a gaming app, that might mean completing a level or gaining
experience points.
How to measure: Use a product analytics tool to tag your defined critical event and measure the number of
unique users who fire that event each month.

Stickiness - Stickiness shows how often your users are coming back each month.
How to measure: Divide your daily active users by your monthly active users (or another metric of time,
like weekly active users) to find your “stickiness” rate. If you have a stickiness rate of 50 percent, for example,
that shows your users come back on 15 out of 30 days each month. Stickiness = DAU / MAU

Stickiness is a percentage that shows how often your monthly users return daily. DAU/MAU. It can also be defined as DAU/WAU, WAU/MAU


Churn rate is the inverse of your retention rate. It is a measure of how many users stopped returning to your product.
How to measure: Calculate your churn rate by dividing your total number of active users at the end of the month
by the total number of active users at the beginning of the month. You can also calculate churn by week or year,
depending on which interval is of interest.
Churn rate = Total active users at end of time period / Total active users at start of time period

Once you have your churn rate, you can dive deeper to see how those churn rates differ across devices, geography
or any other demographic you are interested in. This analysis may reveal that certain types of users account for
higher churn than others.


Customer lifetime value: is the value of a customer across their entire relationship with your company.
Lifelong, frequent customers provide more value to a business than one-time customers.
How to measure: 
Customer value = Average purchase frequency X Average value of purchase
Customer lifetime value = Customer value X Average customer lifespan

Understanding which customers drive the most value for your business will help you prioritize
where to invest your resources to improve the product. If your high-value customers love a certain feature, then it
benefits your product team to continue improving that feature over something that’s used less, or only matters to
users who don’t provide as much value.

Monthly recurring revenue(MRR) = Subscribers X Average monthly revenue per user (can be calculated similary for Annual Reccurring Revenue)

Net Revenue Retention -  Like user retention, net revenue retention is the revenue you retain over a given period. It’s usually
measured monthly. Net revenue retention is important because it measures how well you are holding on to your existing customer base. If your net revenue retention rate is growing, so is your business.

NRR = MRR at end of time period / MRR at beginning of time period

Average revenue per user (ARPU) - is the revenue your company generates per user. Calculating average revenue per user lets you see how much value the average user brings to your business. Average revenue per user can provide a benchmark for making certain product decisions. 

How to measure: If you generate revenue solely through subscriptions that have only one price, you already know
this number, and it’s probably not going to change often. Otherwise, divide your revenue over a given timeframe
by the number of users you had over that same timeframe to determine average revenue per user.
ARPU = Monthly revenue / Monthly active users


**North Star Metric**

A North Star Metric is a leading indicator you can track to determine whether you are meeting your
product goals and delivering value to your customers. It is sometimes the most important metric your company
tracks, because it helps assess whether your product and customer experience are on track with the long-term
company vision.
How to measure: How you measure your North Star Metric will depend upon the metric your team sets as the
North Star. 

Don’t waste your time with vanity metrics. Vanity metrics are measurements that don’t predict or
measure meaningful results for your product. Some examples of vanity metrics are things like page views, “likes”
on social media, and the number of email subscribers. 
Make sure not to whittle away the metrics that still give you important context and insight into user behavior.
You can measure activation rate alone, for instance. However, if you don’t also measure how quickly you convert
acquired users to activated customers, it can be easy to miss an opportunity to make onboarding more efficient.
That oversight would mean it’s taking longer to show users value, making it more likely they will churn.
